      This command will be run before the Jupyter notebook is started.
      It is useful for setting up the virtual environment you want to run your notebook in.
      
      Accepted formats:
        
        - `source /<venv-path>/bin/activate`
        
        - `conda activate <env-name>`

      **Note:** Ensure that Jupyter is installed in the environment.
